                my family financially very well settled my cousins means my father bros & sisters refused me to do job... in family occasions everyone was questioning my father that u have plenty of money why Revathi is doing job then I became bold to give answers to them may be I adopted it as my habit for being my Self ..

                I had lot of support from my father & hubby to fulfill my wishes...they also got attention on me through my achievements only ...for getting attention i worked very hard to get good ranks nd all so which is not possible Without time management...
